Thought for 2 secondsYes, you're right. Many of these components would need corresponding implementations in your Zig backend code. Here's how the responsibilities would be divided:

### In the Zig Microcontroller Backend:

- **Communication Protocol Implementation**: The binary protocol encoding/decoding
- **Command Generation**: Creating the machine-level instructions
- **State Management**: Tracking the robot's current position and status
- **Control Algorithms**: PID controllers, motion planning, kinematics
- **Virtual Hardware Drivers**: Code that would normally talk to motor drivers, but instead sends commands to the simulation
- **Sensor Data Processing**: Code to receive and process the virtual sensor data
- **Safety Systems**: All the limit checks, collision detection, etc.
- **Real-time Scheduling**: Maintaining the 1kHz control loop


### In the Communication Bridge (could be Zig or another language):

- **Protocol Translation**: Converting between microcontroller communication and WebSockets
- **Message Buffering**: Handling timing differences
- **Data Serialization/Deserialization**: Converting between binary and JSON if needed


### In the Frontend (React/Three.js):

- **Command Interpreter**: Translating received commands into visual changes
- **Physics Simulation**: Modeling how a real robot would respond
- **Virtual Sensor Generation**: Creating realistic feedback data
- **Visualization**: Rendering the robot's state


The key is that your Zig code should be written as if it were controlling real hardware - with the same timing constraints, safety checks, and control algorithms. The only difference would be that instead of writing to physical motor driver pins, you'd be sending those commands over a communication channel to the simulation.

This approach gives you a true 1:1 development environment where the Zig code you write for the simulation could theoretically be deployed to real hardware with minimal changes (just swapping virtual drivers for real ones).
