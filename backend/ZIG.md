Thought for 4 secondsTo create a 1:1 replica controller for the KUKA arm simulation, you'd need to build the following components:

### Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller board with sufficient processing power (STM32, ESP32, or a custom board with a Zig-compatible MCU)
- Motor drivers for each of the 7 joints (H-bridge or dedicated servo controllers)
- Current sensors for each motor
- Position encoders for each joint (absolute or incremental)
- Temperature sensors for motors and drivers
- Emergency stop circuit
- Power management system (voltage regulators, protection circuits)
- Communication interfaces (UART, CAN bus, Ethernet)
- Status LEDs and diagnostic display


### Software Architecture

- Real-time operating system or bare-metal firmware written in Zig
- Motor control loop running at 1kHz (as in your simulation)
- PID controllers for each joint
- Inverse kinematics solver
- Motion planning system
- State machine for operational modes
- Error detection and handling
- Command interpreter for external control


### Communication Protocols

- Industrial protocol implementation (EtherCAT, PROFINET, or Modbus)
- Command API matching the simulation interface
- Telemetry data streaming
- Diagnostic interface


### Control Systems

- Joint-level PID control with anti-windup
- Trajectory generation
- Coordinate transformation (joint space to Cartesian space)
- Velocity and acceleration limiting
- Torque monitoring and limiting


### Safety Systems

- Joint limit enforcement (software and hardware)
- Collision detection algorithms
- Watchdog timers
- Fault detection and safe shutdown procedures
- User safety zones implementation


### Firmware Structure

- Low-level hardware abstraction layer
- Motor control module
- Sensor reading and filtering
- Communication stack
- State management
- User command processing
- Diagnostic logging


This would give you a complete system that could theoretically control a physical KUKA-style robot arm with the same capabilities as your simulation, with the Zig firmware serving as the bridge between hardware and the robot's behavior.
